1. Problem Selection: Sorting

•	Sorting is a basic yet crucial operation in many applications. Sorting data helps in searching, organizing, and making further operations efficient.
•	Merge Sort and Quick Sort are two popular sorting algorithms, each with unique strengths.

2. Algorithm Analysis: Strengths and Weaknesses

•	Merge Sort:
o	Strengths: It has a consistent performance for large datasets, even in the worst-case scenario, as its time complexity is always O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)O(nlogn).
o	Weaknesses: Merge Sort requires additional memory space to merge parts of the array, so it may not be as memory-efficient.
o	When to Use: Best for large, unsorted datasets that require stable performance.

•	Quick Sort:
o	Strengths: Quick Sort generally performs faster than Merge Sort because it doesn’t require extra space for merging. It works well with smaller arrays and partially sorted data.
o	Weaknesses: It can perform poorly on already sorted or reverse-sorted data if the pivot (element used to divide the array) is not chosen well, potentially leading to O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2) performance.
o	When to Use: Works best with small datasets or partially sorted arrays due to its low overhead for small arrays.


3. Hybrid Design: Combining Quick Sort and Merge Sort

•	Goal: Use the strengths of both algorithms in a single hybrid algorithm.     
•	Strategy: We’ll use Quick Sort’s efficient partitioning method for small and partially sorted arrays, but if an array or sub-array is large, we’ll switch to Merge Sort to avoid Quick Sort’s worst-case performance.


Steps in the Hybrid Design:

1.	Partitioning with Quick Sort:
o	We start sorting the array using Quick Sort, which splits (partitions) the array around a pivot element, separating it into smaller sub-arrays.
2.	Switching to Merge Sort for Large Sub-arrays:
o	If any sub-array size becomes larger than a chosen threshold (e.g., 50 elements), we switch to Merge Sort to sort that part. Merge Sort provides more stable performance on larger arrays and prevents the worst-case scenario of Quick Sort.

3.	Recursive Sorting:
o	We apply the above steps recursively on each partition, ensuring that small portions use Quick Sort, while large portions use Merge Sort.

4. Performance Analysis: Evaluating the Hybrid Algorithm

Theoretical Analysis
•	Best Case Performance: O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)O(nlogn), similar to Quick Sort’s best and average cases.
•	Worst Case Performance: Improved over Quick Sort alone. By using Merge Sort on large portions, we avoid Quick Sort’s worst-case scenario of O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2), achieving a consistent O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)O(nlogn) performance even for large, unsorted datasets.
•	Space Complexity: Close to Merge Sort’s complexity due to extra space required for merging large portions, so O(n)O(n)O(n) in total.

Experimental Analysis
To test the hybrid algorithm, we would:
•	Create several datasets (like random, sorted, and reverse-sorted arrays) and measure the performance of Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and the hybrid algorithm on each dataset.
•	Record metrics such as execution time, memory usage, and the number of recursive calls.
This testing helps verify if the hybrid algorithm truly combines the best aspects of both algorithms and performs well under a variety of conditions.
